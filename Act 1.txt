ACT 1 – APOLLONIA

	INTRODUCTION – The Sick Town

		Apollonia, once a proud medieval settlement built atop the ruins of an ancient magical empire, is dying. 
		A creeping plague blackens the fields, sickens the townsfolk, and twists animals into horrors. 
		When the sun sets behind the shattered towers of the old world, monsters rise—aberrations born of corrupted magic.

		A legend whispers that all this suffering is tied to an ancient curse, fed by an awakening evil known only as "Pigg". 
		Some say {Boss} was human once. Others believe it is a relic of the apocalypse, a creature older than the Cataclysm. 
		Whatever the truth, Apollonia’s people believe one thing:

		The curse is growing stronger, and time is running out.

		The town elder’s child approaches you, pleading for your help. You must follow the legend and uncover the truth.


CHAPTER 1 – The Lost Relic

	The Relic of Binding

		Long ago, a powerful object known as the Relic of Binding was used to imprison Pigg. 
		But when the warlock Pigg attempted to harness its power, the relic shattered, and he became trapped in a mythical sealed sanctuary.

		The relic broke into three fragments, scattered across the corrupted landscape. 
		Your task: recover all three pieces.

	Each Fragment & Guardian

		Fragment I – The Verdant Shard
			Location: Rotwood Grove, a once-sacred druid forest now overrun by mutating plant-flesh creatures.
			Guardian: The Moss-Tyrant, a colossal tree-beast fused with old-world metal and bone.

		Fragment II – The Ember Core
			Location: The Ashen Quarry, a collapsed settlement suffocated by toxic fog and molten fissures.
			Guardian: The Scorchbound Golem, a living furnace of cursed ore and relentless fire.

		Fragment III – The Umbral Lens
			Location: The Hollowed Academy, ruins of a magical university fractured by unstable reality.
			Guardian: The Echo Wraith, a spectral mage that splits into mirror illusions.


CHAPTER 2 – Restoring the Relic

		After collecting all fragments, you learn they cannot be restored without rare ritual materials:
			- Tears of Stone
			- Boneglass
			- Furnace Dust

		Only one person knew the restoration ritual: Aldren Ironshaper, Apollonia’s legendary blacksmith.

		He died decades ago.

		You seek Old Mother Ysera, the last witch of Apollonia, who performs a forbidden spirit-binding ritual.
		Through her magic, you speak with Aldren’s undead spirit in the spectral plane.

		Aldren reforges the Relic of Binding with your help, but warns before fading:

			“Someone in Apollonia has lied to you.”


CHAPTER 3 – The Secret Portal

		The restored relic reveals a hidden location beneath an ancient citadel older than Apollonia itself.

		To access it, you must:
			- Solve magical rune puzzles
			- Decipher post-apocalyptic glyphs
			- Navigate a labyrinth that shifts with moonlight

		Deep within the sanctum, you place the relic into a stone mechanism. 
		A portal tears open, revealing a new realm:

		The Forsaken Expanse — a fusion of medieval magic and post-apocalyptic debris.


CHAPTER 4 – Confronting the Terror

		The Forsaken Expanse is guarded by twisted creatures and ancient magical constructs. 
		Defeating them brings you to the true horror:

		Pigg, the ancient evil feeding on the curse.

		In battle, Pigg reveals a chilling truth:

			“I was sealed away not by heroes… 
			 but by {the father who gave you the quest}. He feared what I knew.”

		After defeating Pigg, you return to Apollonia. 
		The town celebrates, but the elder’s child has vanished.

		Clues reveal the darkest truth yet:

		The real traitor—the true mastermind—was living among you all along.

		Act 1 ends with the revelation:
			The one who sent you on the quest is the real Boss.
